In this project, we will be applying Multinomial Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and 
Neural Network algorithms for solving a multi-class classification problem, along with Principal 
Component Analysis  (PCA)  as  a pre-processing step.
We will apply  the above machine  learning 
algorithms on a simulated dataset first, and then these algorithms will be applied on a real-world dataset. 

The goal  of this  project  is  to  implement  all three algorithms  correctly, and provide a comparative 
analysis based on the following machine learning evaluation metrics: 
Bias/Variance Tradeoff: We will use Normalized-Test-MSE to determine the Bias/Variance 
Tradeoff for each algorithm as in Homework-2. 
Accuracy, Precision and Recall: We will determine the accuracy metric for each algorithm to 
evaluate  performance  as  in  Homework-4.  The  performance  metrics  will  be  extended  to 
determine Precision and Recall also. 
F-Measure (F1 Score): We will determine the F1 Score based on the Precision (Pr) and Recall 
(Rc) values for each algorithm
